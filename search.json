    "text": "The graph shows the predicted soil CO2 efflux (or soil respiration rate) against the moisture content of the soil. It compares two treatments: brush packs and a control (no treatment). The predictions are derived from a linear mixed-effects model with treatment, moisture, and the interaction between treatment and moisture (VWC) as fixed effects, with site measured as a random effect to account for spatial variation in respiration. Each prediction is plotted with 95% confidence intervals (shaded regions).\nThe cool part is the main effects of both the brush pack treatment and moisture were negative. So, you might expect to see brush packs with high moisture levels having relatively lower efflux values. Nope! As you can see in the graph this is not the case! There is this huge interaction effect between moisture and the brush pack treatment (see below table of fixed effects). It’s so huge that it overpowers the negative main effect of moisture and leads to brush pack treated sites having higher efflux than the control at higher moisture levels. If you interpret this for management, it could mean that brush packs improve CO2 efflux in environments with higher moisture levels. However, as you can see in the graph the 95% confidence intervals are mostly overlapping so there isn’t really a significant difference in efflux between treatments, at least over the range of moisture levels I sampled.\nAnother cool feature of this graph is the confidence interval for the brush pack treatment noticeably widens above 22.5% VWC. While the moisture values sampled across both treatments ranged from 11-27% (x-axis range), no data sampled from the brush pack sites had moisture levels above 22.5%. The model has tried to account for this uncertainty by widening the confidence interval.\nSee photo of what a brush pack looks like below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects:\nEstimate\nStd.

    "text": "Sankey diagram. LTFU: Lost to follow-up. No data: participant did not return for repeat frailty assessment but vital status known.\n\n\nThis graphic describes a prospective cohort study examining the prevalence of Fried frailty phenotype, transitions in frailty status over longitudinal assessment and the impact on survival and kidney transplant outcomes among ambulatory outpatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and undergoing haemodialysis (HD).\nParticipants with advanced CKD (eGFR &lt;20ml/min) or on maintenance HD were assessment for frailty as baseline, 6- and 12 months of follow-up. Participants provided informed opt-out consent. Exclusion criteria included prevalent or incident dementia. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and kidney transplantation events.\nFrailty was identified in 36.3% of the 256 study participants, while an additional 46.5% demonstrated prefrailty. Frailty was highly static with improvements in frailty status noted as frequently as frailty progression. Multivariable analysis based on Cox Proportional Hazards modelling demonstrated that frailty outperformed age, comorbidity, disability and laboratory parameters in predicting mortality risk with hazard ratio (HR) 2.83 (95% CI 1.44-5.56, p&lt;0.001). Frailty also substantially reduced access to kidney transplantation HR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.64, P = 0.01). Study strengths include a high degree of data completeness within a study population that has traditionally proven challenging for research activity. Frailty assessment was acceptable to patients when combined with pragmatic research principles that aligned research activity into standard clinical care. This approach offers opportunities to capture real-world data with a high degree of external validity.\nThis study demonstrates that frailty assessment is a novel prognostic tool. These data strongly support the incorporation of objective measures of frailty into routine clinical practice. While currently neglected by nephrology clinical and research agendas, frailty assessment offers opportunity for improved prognostication and individualised care. This study is also unique for its description of frailty dynamics over longitudinal follow-up and reports both progression of frailty and improvement in frailty, accompanied by change in mortality risk. Effective frailty interventions are a research priority."

    "text": "Figure 1: Perceived causes of Algorithm Debt by roles\n\n\n\nThe graphic (Figure 1), is a radar chart, that visualises the results of a study conducted on the perceived causes of Algorithm Debt in Machine and Deep Learning systems. Algorithm Debt refers to the accumulation of inefficiencies, trade-offs, and overlooked design decisions that can undermine the long-term reliability of Machine and Deep Learning systems. The goal of this study was to investigate how different practitioner roles incur Algorithm Debt to inform mitigation strategies for Algorithm Debt. 65 respondents working in Machine and Deep Learning systems development including Researchers, Developers, Engineers, and Analysts, were surveyed using a questionnaire delivered via ANU Qualtrics. These participants were asked to evaluate six key contributors to AD: algorithmic complexity, lack of developer knowledge, tight deadlines, insufficient documentation, insufficient testing, and lack of team collaboration. Now, what is displayed in the chart is the result of how each participant grouped by role, rated these factors. From the chart, each color represents a distinct role. Algorithmic complexity stood out across the board, with 83% of Analysts and 79% of Researchers identifying it as a major issue. Engineers, on the other hand, identified knowledge gaps (90%) and deadline pressure (80%) as their top concerns. Developers were more focused on documentation and testing, with only 29% citing documentation. Team collaboration was rated lowest, but still seen as relevant by Engineers and Analysts.\nWhat this means is that AD is not a one-size-fits-all problem, but is affected by rolespecific challenges. This radar chart above helps us visualise the differences and points to the need for tailored interventions for each role. These findings led to the development of an integrated framework on AD that was later developed during my thesis, and they overall highlight the importance of managing AD proactively to ensure the reliability of ML/DL systems as they scale."

    "title": "Regional ocean model configuration with accurate representation of the Tasman Sea internal wave beam",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a figure from a submitted paper showing my high resolution regional ocean model used for studying internal waves in the Tasman Sea. Now, the other figures in the paper actually show scientific results, but internal waves are notoriously hard to visualise nicely, and I don’t think the other technical figures are nearly as pretty.\nHere we have the surface speed of the ocean in blue, showing the East Australian current, and an eddy just about to pinch off near Sydney. In the inset domain, we have the analysis region. This shows the topography, most notably an underwater mountain range called Macquarie Ridge just south of New Zealand. This is generating a powerful internal wave, whose energy flux (a measure of energy transfer) shown with green arrows point towards Tasmania like a laser beam.\nThis energy flux that I calculated from my model output matched observations really well, and we were able to study how the beam behaves when the model is run at coarser resolutions.\nThese waves are big: they start out with wavelengths of about 200km, but can’t break and release their energy until they’ve been downscaled. Subsequent figures in the paper break down this energy flux into components with different scales, to help us understand which processes cause the waves to scatter to smaller scales. An important process is the interaction with the Tasmanian continental slope to the west.\nIt turns out that at least a 2km horizontal resolution is required to match observations here, meaning that most models used today wouldn’t be getting this energy pathway right. Consequently, these models would be slightly biased in the rate of vertical mixing near Tasmania, in turn affecting how heat, nutrients and carbon are transferred from the deep to the surface."

The figure includes time-series and correlation scatterplots for two modern shells (ATT13M02 in red, ATT13M03 in blue, rows 1-2) and three submodern shells (ATT13011 in green, ATT13116 in orange, ATT13136 in brown, rows 3-5), with a combined Predicted SST plot against OISST (1980–2015).\nThe aim is to validate the equation, derived from ATT13M02 and ATT13M03 using δ¹⁸O_shell_minus_seawater, by applying it to submodern shells from the same site to assess its robustness. Time-series plots show δ¹⁸O_shell_minus_seawater (per mil) on the left y-axis and SST (°C) on the right, with Observed SST from the OISST v2 dataset (monthly resolution, black solid line) and Predicted SST (colored dashed lines) calculated using the equation. Integer years mark the x-axis. Scatterplots on the right compare Observed SST (OISST v2) and Predicted SST, with Pearson correlations (e.g., r = 0.763 for ATT13M02).\nThe bottom plot aims to compare Predicted SSTs from all shells against OISST v2 Observed SST (1980–2015), highlighting temporal consistency and model reliability. High-resolution (300 ppi) plots, saved without grids and with labeled subplots, use DejaVu font for δ¹⁸O symbols and were generated with Python. This work supports paleoclimate reconstruction, providing insights into SST variations and their implications for South Pacific coral reef ecosystems. Conclusion: High r (0.74–0.87) shows strong variability match, better in submodern shells due to clearer signals."

    "text": "Melioidosis, a lethal disease caused by the soil-based bacterium, Burkholderia pseu-domallei, is endemic in northeastern Queensland. Case reporting typically increases during the wet season, from November to April, which brings heavy rainfall to the region.\nIn 2025, Queensland experienced a sudden threefold increase in melioidosis cases, ex-ceeding expectations for this jurisdiction during the same year-to-date period. Nearly 90% of cases originated from two Hospital and Health Service (HHS) regions: Cairns and Townsville. Because the source of infection for most cases was unknown, monitoring the temporal pattern of disease incidence alongside environmental data, such as rain-fall, provided a basis for generating hypotheses about the probable cause of the surge.\nThe graph reveals two clear messages: the 2025 melioidosis case surge exceeded the 2020–2024 mean value, and this event associated with heavy rainfall. The epidemic curve itself demonstrated a sharp increase in illness, specifically showing two distinct peaks in cases during the outbreak period from late January to late April. When plotting this disease activity against the average daily rainfall, the data confirmed a positive correla-tion (Pearson; r = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28-0.59) during the outbreak period.\nThis correlation supports the theory that heavy rainfall and stormy weather events re-lease the bacteria from the soil. When heavy rain loosens the earth and raises the water table, these bacteria reach the surface. Strong wind might then aerosolize and dissemi-nate the bacteria, resulting in an increased infection. This visual evidence directly sup-ported public health advice urging vulnerable people, such as older adults or those with comorbidities, to shelter during heavy rain, to use personal protective equipment and to avoid contact with mud and floodwaters to reduce the risk of contracting the disease."

    "text": "This animated scatterplot documents the demographic transition of Latin America and the Caribbean from 1950 to 2025, using data from the UN World Population Prospects 2024. The visualization tracks two fundamental demographic indicators—life expectancy and total fertility rate—for countries with populations over 100,000 in 2025.\nThe plot enables a detailed examination of population changes across different sub-regions. By representing each country as a moving point, the animation reveals how life expectancy and fertility rates have evolved over 75 years. Color distinctions highlight the diverse trajectories of Caribbean, Central American, and South American nations.\nA horizontal line at 2.1 fertility represents the replacement level, providing a critical reference point for understanding population dynamics. The visualization’s design allows viewers to perceive the pace of demographic change: rapid shifts appear as long jumps between data points, while gradual transitions show shorter movements.\nDifferent regions exhibit distinct patterns of demographic transition. Central America shows compressed fertility declines, with population rates changing dramatically in short periods. The Southern Cone reached sub-replacement fertility earlier, while the Caribbean demonstrates more varied demographic paths, including periods of stagnation and unexpected reversals.\nThe animation also captures significant demographic disruptions. The 2010 Haitian earthquake is visible as a sudden leftward movement, illustrating how catastrophic events can immediately impact population dynamics. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic’s global effect is represented through synchronized reductions in life expectancy across multiple countries in 2020.\nThis visualization represents the first step in my doctoral research, exploring demographic transition in Latin America and the Caribbean through the lens of the pace of change. By making the pace of population changes visible, it offers a different perspective on understanding regional demographic dynamics."

    "text": "Microbiome-derived heritability for a particular microbiome function can be calculated through the covariance between donor and recipient microbiomes. Here, microbiome function is measured as Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) mass.\nBSFL were inoculated with an Endogenous (i.e. native) microbiome or a Perturbed Endogenous microbiome with additional external microbes. 100 replicates of each treatment were inoculated for Generation 1 and the total larvae mass measured after three weeks. The resulting microbiome from Generation 1 was inoculated into Generation 2, following the donor-recipient design. The slope of a linear model, r2 and the slope’s significance is annotated for each treatment. Perfect microbiome-derived heritability (slope = 1) is depicted by a red dashed line.\nThe Endogenous microbiome exhibits a significant slope of 0.37 and r2 is 0.12. A significant microbiome-derived heritability is essential for microbiome selection, where the best performing microbiomes are selectively propagated across generations to ‘breed’ a functional microbiome. The significant microbiome-derived heritability suggests that microbiome selection may be possible, but the low r2 indicates there is likely to be large variability in the recipient generation. The Perturbed Endogenous microbiome shows a non-significant slope, suggesting it would not be amenable to microbiome selection. The red line provides a useful comparison of theoretical maximum microbiome-derived heritability.\nFurthermore, the rug plots make visualisation of the mean and variance easier. Significantly greater mean mass of the Perturbed Endogenous treatment suggests that external microbes can have beneficial effects. This mean increase is consistent across generations, indicating it is heritable at a treatment level, but not at a replicate level, given the lack of a significant slope. The Perturbed Endogenous treatment also had greater variance than the Endogenous treatment, external microbes may result in more variability in BSFL mass outcomes.\nThis figure depicts data collected during my Honours degree."

    "text": "SHAP plots for predicting Insufficient Weight class in Obesity dataset with MLP classifier under ungrouped and grouped cases. Left is ungrouped case and right is grouped case via bicriterion method.\n\n\nMachine learning models are increasingly applied in clinical settings, yet their complexity often leads to the propagation of bias and reduces the interpretability of the decision-making process. “SHIELD: SHapley and Information-theory based framework for Equitable Learning via Dissimilar feature grouping” addresses this by grouping maximally dissimilar features, learning on a latent representation, and decoding attributions back to native variables. SHAP quantifies each feature’s contribution by showing how different feature values positively or negatively influence the model’s prediction.\nThe paired plots contrast SHAP summaries of ungrouped (raw) versus SHIELD (bicriterion grouping) for predicting Insufficient Weight in the Obesity dataset via MLP classifier. In the ungrouped case, attribution concentrates on anthropometrics (Weight, Height, Age) with many instances near zero SHAP value, meaning the participants’ records essentially did not contribute to any decision (i.e., wasted). Under SHIELD, explanatory credit is more equitably spread out. This demonstrates a more nuanced consideration of lifestyle and contextual features, such as NCP (# of meals per day), FCVC (consumption of vegetables), CAEC (consumption of food between meals), MTRANS_Public_Transportation and family_history_with_overweight_{yes/no}, as the model engages more instances and reveals environmental contributors rather than relying almost exclusively on Height and Weight. The graphic further illustrates that this equitable learning is achieved while remaining consistent with domain knowledge. For example, individuals without a family history of overweight and with low vegetable intake are less likely to belong to the insufficient weight class, whereas those with lower body weight and infrequent consumption of high-calorie foods (FAVC_no) are more likely to be classified as insufficient weight.\nPractical implications of this framework include broader actionable levers for clinicians (e.g., dietary patterns, snacking, transport), greater sample efficiency through better use of instances, panel rationalisation by reducing dependence on immutable traits, and improved auditability via decoder-mapped SHAP."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This heatmap visualises the cytokine landscape induced by 14 Bacillus species, uncovering a distinct inflammasome activation signature associated with bacterial toxicity. Each row represents a Bacillus species, and each column corresponds to one of 32 cytokines released by wild-type bone marrow–derived macrophages following 3 hours of stimulation. Cytokine values were normalised to the mean of each cytokine across all species, allowing for direct comparison of relative induction patterns independent of baseline variability.\nA prominent red cluster emerges for toxigenic species such as B. cereus, B. idriensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides and B. thuringiensis, reflecting robust induction of canonical inflammasome-associated cytokines such as the IL-1β cytokine. In contrast, non-toxigenic strains such as B. subtilis and B. megaterium form a muted grey cluster, indicating a limited inflammatory response. Hierarchical organization of the data reveals a clear separation between inflammatory and low-response phenotypes without the need for manual grouping, highlighting the discriminatory power of the pattern itself.\nThis visualization encapsulates a fundamental principle of host–pathogen interaction: toxin-mediated inflammasome activation imprints a distinctive cytokine signature that separates pathogenic from environmental Bacillus strains. The use of a single colour gradient focuses attention on biologically meaningful contrasts while maintaining interpretability for non-specialists. By condensing high-dimensional multiplex data into a structured, visually intuitive format, the heatmap transforms a complex dataset into a clear mechanistic narrative.\nBeyond its immunological insight, this figure demonstrates how deliberate visualization design can reveal pathogen-specific inflammatory fingerprints at a glance, bridging experimental data with conceptual understanding. It underscores how data visualization is not merely descriptive but an analytical tool in itself."

    "text": "The topsoil (0.15 m) pH for each landform element across the study site. The green line indicates neutral pH 7, and the red line indicates that any measure below 5.5 is considered strongly acid pH (Isbell 2016).\n\n\nFor part of my Honours thesis, I undertook topsoil sampling surveys that utilised a systematic sampling protocol. Systematic sampling uses a zigzag pattern of randomly selected soil cores (to a depth of 0.15 m) across a series of transects stratified by soil type in an area or paddock (Hazelton and Murphy 2016). This method is ideal for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies and for gaining representative results from irregularly shaped landforms (Environmental Analysis Laboratory, n.d.; Local Land Services 2020). The cores taken from an area are bulked, that is, they are placed in a bucket or bag and combined to form a composite homogenous mix from which a sample is taken for analysis (Brown 1999). The topsoil pH across the study site ranges from slightly acidic on the crest, to moderately acidic on the upper slope, mid slope, lower slope and on the flat, and strongly acid in the riparian zone. Soils that are strongly acid, below 5.5 pH, can have chemical characteristics that inhibit plant growth. For example, low pH can result in the mobilisation of exchangeable aluminium (Al3+) into the soil solution causing toxic conditions for plants (Hazelton and Murphy 2016). For this study site the topsoil in the riparian zone was strongly acid and this corresponded with higher measures of exchangeable aluminium in this part of the landscape. I wanted to illustrate the pH scale using a colour gradient matched to the indicator colours of field pH kits, purple indicating alkaline conditions, green neutral conditions ideal for plant growth, and red acidic conditions. I think this method of representation accurately illustrates both the optimum range of soil pH for plant growth and where the data points sit along this spectrum.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, K J. 1999. “Soil Sampling and Sample Handling for Chemical Analysis.” In Soil Analysis: An Interpretation Manual, edited by K I Peverill, L A Sparrow, and D J Reuter, 35–54.
