    "text": "The graph shows the predicted soil CO2 efflux (or soil respiration rate) against the moisture content of the soil. It compares two treatments: brush packs and a control (no treatment). The predictions are derived from a linear mixed-effects model with treatment, moisture, and the interaction between treatment and moisture (VWC) as fixed effects, with site measured as a random effect to account for spatial variation in respiration. Each prediction is plotted with 95% confidence intervals (shaded regions).\nThe cool part is the main effects of both the brush pack treatment and moisture were negative. So, you might expect to see brush packs with high moisture levels having relatively lower efflux values. Nope! As you can see in the graph this is not the case! There is this huge interaction effect between moisture and the brush pack treatment (see below table of fixed effects). It‚Äôs so huge that it overpowers the negative main effect of moisture and leads to brush pack treated sites having higher efflux than the control at higher moisture levels. If you interpret this for management, it could mean that brush packs improve CO2 efflux in environments with higher moisture levels. However, as you can see in the graph the 95% confidence intervals are mostly overlapping so there isn‚Äôt really a significant difference in efflux between treatments, at least over the range of moisture levels I sampled.\nAnother cool feature of this graph is the confidence interval for the brush pack treatment noticeably widens above 22.5% VWC. While the moisture values sampled across both treatments ranged from 11-27% (x-axis range), no data sampled from the brush pack sites had moisture levels above 22.5%. The model has tried to account for this uncertainty by widening the confidence interval.\nSee photo of what a brush pack looks like below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects:\nEstimate\nStd.

    "text": "Sankey diagram. LTFU: Lost to follow-up. No data: participant did not return for repeat frailty assessment but vital status known.\n\n\nThis graphic describes a prospective cohort study examining the prevalence of Fried frailty phenotype, transitions in frailty status over longitudinal assessment and the impact on survival and kidney transplant outcomes among ambulatory outpatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and undergoing haemodialysis (HD).\nParticipants with advanced CKD (eGFR &lt;20ml/min) or on maintenance HD were assessment for frailty as baseline, 6- and 12 months of follow-up. Participants provided informed opt-out consent. Exclusion criteria included prevalent or incident dementia. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and kidney transplantation events.\nFrailty was identified in 36.3% of the 256 study participants, while an additional 46.5% demonstrated prefrailty. Frailty was highly static with improvements in frailty status noted as frequently as frailty progression. Multivariable analysis based on Cox Proportional Hazards modelling demonstrated that frailty outperformed age, comorbidity, disability and laboratory parameters in predicting mortality risk with hazard ratio (HR) 2.83 (95% CI 1.44-5.56, p&lt;0.001). Frailty also substantially reduced access to kidney transplantation HR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.64, P = 0.01). Study strengths include a high degree of data completeness within a study population that has traditionally proven challenging for research activity. Frailty assessment was acceptable to patients when combined with pragmatic research principles that aligned research activity into standard clinical care. This approach offers opportunities to capture real-world data with a high degree of external validity.\nThis study demonstrates that frailty assessment is a novel prognostic tool. These data strongly support the incorporation of objective measures of frailty into routine clinical practice. While currently neglected by nephrology clinical and research agendas, frailty assessment offers opportunity for improved prognostication and individualised care. This study is also unique for its description of frailty dynamics over longitudinal follow-up and reports both progression of frailty and improvement in frailty, accompanied by change in mortality risk. Effective frailty interventions are a research priority."

    "text": "The topsoil (0.15 m) pH for each landform element across the study site. The green line indicates neutral pH 7, and the red line indicates that any measure below 5.5 is considered strongly acid pH (Isbell 2016).\n\n\nFor part of my Honours thesis, I undertook topsoil sampling surveys that utilised a systematic sampling protocol. Systematic sampling uses a zigzag pattern of randomly selected soil cores (to a depth of 0.15 m) across a series of transects stratified by soil type in an area or paddock (Hazelton and Murphy 2016). This method is ideal for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies and for gaining representative results from irregularly shaped landforms (Environmental Analysis Laboratory, n.d.; Local Land Services 2020). The cores taken from an area are bulked, that is, they are placed in a bucket or bag and combined to form a composite homogenous mix from which a sample is taken for analysis (Brown 1999). The topsoil pH across the study site ranges from slightly acidic on the crest, to moderately acidic on the upper slope, mid slope, lower slope and on the flat, and strongly acid in the riparian zone. Soils that are strongly acid, below 5.5 pH, can have chemical characteristics that inhibit plant growth. For example, low pH can result in the mobilisation of exchangeable aluminium (Al3+) into the soil solution causing toxic conditions for plants (Hazelton and Murphy 2016). For this study site the topsoil in the riparian zone was strongly acid and this corresponded with higher measures of exchangeable aluminium in this part of the landscape. I wanted to illustrate the pH scale using a colour gradient matched to the indicator colours of field pH kits, purple indicating alkaline conditions, green neutral conditions ideal for plant growth, and red acidic conditions. I think this method of representation accurately illustrates both the optimum range of soil pH for plant growth and where the data points sit along this spectrum.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, K J. 1999. ‚ÄúSoil Sampling and Sample Handling for Chemical Analysis.‚Äù In Soil Analysis: An Interpretation Manual, edited by K I Peverill, L A Sparrow, and D J Reuter, 35‚Äì54.
