![SHAP plots for predicting Insufficient Weight class in Obesity dataset with MLP classifier under
ungrouped and grouped cases. Left is ungrouped case and right is grouped case via bicriterion method.](`r rmarkdown::metadata$image`)

Machine learning models are increasingly applied in clinical settings, yet their complexity often leads to
the propagation of bias and reduces the interpretability of the decision-making process. “SHIELD: **SH**apley
and **I**nformation-theory based framework for **E**quitable **L**earning via **D**issimilar feature grouping” addresses
this by grouping maximally dissimilar features, learning on a latent representation, and decoding attributions
back to native variables. SHAP quantifies each feature’s contribution by showing how different feature values
positively or negatively influence the model’s prediction.

The paired plots contrast SHAP summaries of ungrouped (raw) versus SHIELD (bicriterion grouping) for
predicting _Insufficient Weight_ in the Obesity dataset via MLP classifier. In the ungrouped case, attribution
concentrates on anthropometrics (`Weight`, `Height`, `Age`) with many instances near zero SHAP value, meaning
the participants’ records essentially did not contribute to any decision (i.e., wasted). Under SHIELD, explanatory
credit is more equitably spread out. This demonstrates a more nuanced consideration of lifestyle and
contextual features, such as NCP (# of meals per day), FCVC (consumption of vegetables), CAEC (consumption
of food between meals), `MTRANS_Public_Transportation` and `family_history_with_overweight_{yes/no}`,
as the model engages more instances and reveals environmental contributors rather than relying almost exclusively
on `Height` and `Weight`. The graphic further illustrates that this equitable learning is achieved
while remaining consistent with domain knowledge. For example, individuals without a family history of
overweight and with low vegetable intake are less likely to belong to the insufficient weight class, whereas
those with lower body weight and infrequent consumption of high-calorie foods (`FAVC_no`) are more likely to
be classified as insufficient weight.

Practical implications of this framework include broader actionable levers for clinicians (e.g., dietary
patterns, snacking, transport), greater sample efficiency through better use of instances, panel rationalisation
by reducing dependence on immutable traits, and improved auditability via decoder-mapped SHAP.
